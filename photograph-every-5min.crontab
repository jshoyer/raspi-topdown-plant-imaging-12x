# Use this one for the RasPis in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 12.
# Cf. the nearly identical file:photograph-with-flips-every-5min.crontab
# for the five RasPis that are oriented 180Â° the other way.

# We assume that the timezone on each RasPi is set to UTC---see README.org
# We could force cron to use UTC by uncommenting the following:
#CRON_TZ=UTC
# (and then running 'sudo service cron restart').
# However, if we did that,
# the file names would still match the system timezone,
# which could cause confusion.
